# Deferred follow-ups

Tracked here so we don't lose them after PR #49 lands. None of these
block correctness; they are all "structural / maintainability" items
the reviewer flagged as P2.

> 2026-09-03 v2 refactor round update: §1 superseded by `html_report_v2/`
> (thin shell + gzipped lazy assets; legacy renderer kept behind
> `--html-renderer legacy`). New follow-ups recorded in §11-§14.

## 1. `html_report.py` modularization — SUPERSEDED

Superseded by the `html_report_v2/` package (shell.py / payloads.py /
assets.py + app.css/app.js): data/view separation is achieved there by
construction. The legacy monolith stays frozen behind
`--html-renderer legacy` and will not be modularized.

The file is currently ~3 k lines mixing data loading, metrics,
view-model construction, CSS, and JS. Recommended split (see review §6.4):

```
ascend_profile/html_report/
  __init__.py     # re-exports build_html_report for callers
  data.py         # Bundle, Event, _attach_raw_rows
  metrics.py     # short_op_name, union_duration_us, kernel_rollup_by_bound
  styles.py       # CSS + JS template strings
  views.py        # render_l1_view / render_l2_views / render_l3_views
  renderer.py    # render_head / render_foot / build_html_report
```

Risk: CSS is composed via f-string today; moving it requires careful
brace-escaping. Defer until we touch the views again.

**Partial progress (Phase 3):** the data layer is unified — `_load_events`
delegates to `metrics.load_events_csv` and adapts into the render-side
`Event` view (`Event.from_normalized`); `load_csv` / `load_json` delegate to
`store.csv_rows` / `store.read_json`. What remains is the view/CSS split
above.

## 2. `common.py` split — DONE (Phase 3)

`common.py` was split by responsibility; it remains as a
backwards-compatible facade that re-exports the full historic public
surface (new code should import from the real modules):

```
ascend_profile/
  models.py     # schema dataclasses (SourceRef, NormalizedEvent, segments, …)
  store.py      # JSON/JSONL/CSV/XLSX IO, id/time, coercion helpers, KNOWLEDGE_DIR
  sources.py    # rank-dir discovery + kernel_details row extraction
  pipeline.py   # CANN pipeline-stage metrics, op_type, bound_class
  work.py       # FLOP/byte estimates from shape fields
  rules.py      # categories_and_roles (YAML-driven), attention-family resolver
  metrics.py    # interval union / bubbles, quantile, artifact loaders
  common.py     # facade re-exporting the above
```

## 3. `segment.py` split

The segmentation module is ~2.7 k lines and has the highest correctness
impact in the framework. Suggested package layout:

```
ascend_profile/segment/
  anchors.py        # role / anchor extraction
  layers.py         # layer observations
  frames.py         # frame / step plan composition
  validators.py     # exact-cover / residual / composite-body validation
  materialize.py    # StepSegment / LayerSegment / EvidenceRef writeout
  __init__.py
```

Risk: this is the single most error-prone module. Defer until we have
golden-output regression tests across our reference profiling cases.

## 4. JSON schema registry

Today, each stage writes its own `*_manifest.json` with a stage-local
shape; the skill launcher reads scalar fields out of them. A
`schemas/*.schema.json` registry plus JSON-schema validation would
let us:

* fail fast on stage-output drift
* document the artifact surface in one place
* power IDE auto-complete for downstream consumers

The old `schemas/analysis_bundle.schema.json` draft was deleted (zero
consumers — nothing loaded or validated it). A future registry would start
from the per-stage `*_manifest.json` payloads and
`knowledge/semantic_conventions.yaml`, not from that draft.

## 5. Taxonomy externalization — DONE (Phase 3)

`categories_and_roles()` is data-driven: the ordered rule list lives in
`knowledge/kernel_signatures.yaml:match_rules` and is loaded (and
schema-validated) at runtime by `rules.py`. The attention-family resolver
similarly loads `knowledge/attention_families.yaml:cheat_sheet.resolver`.
Adding operator families (new attention kernels, new MoE primitives) is a
YAML edit.

`scripts/ascend_profile/knowledge/semantic_conventions.yaml` pins the enum
catalogue (`op_type`, `op_roles`, `op_categories`, `bound_family`,
`block_kind`, `finding_type`, `anomaly_tag`, `dominant_idle_pattern`,
`soft_root_cause_label`, `alignment_method`, `alignment_confidence`,
`html_status`, `report_mode`). `tests/test_semantic_conventions.py` plus
`tests/test_kernel_signatures.py` keep the emitted values and the YAML in
sync (including the full set of categories/roles the matcher can emit).

`moe_families.yaml` remains an optional reference table with no production
consumer; `tests/test_moe_families.py` covers the corresponding behavior.
The finding thresholds /
wording moved to `knowledge/diagnosis_rules.yaml` while the finding
*conditions* intentionally stay in `diagnostics.py`.

## 5b. Segmentation strategy

Segmentation strategy stays in `segment.py`; the implemented layer-anchor
configuration lives in `knowledge/segmentation_rules.yaml`. The earlier
proposal for another strategy YAML is retired. A new data format is useful
only if a concrete code change needs it; reference knowledge does not need
externalization or a rule language.

## 6. Stage resume from interrupted run

The new `--from-stage` / `--to-stage` selectors in `analyze.py` cover
forward resumes when prior outputs are intact. A richer "stage cache"
that detects stale inputs and replays only the dirty stages is the
natural next step, especially once we have schema validation in place.

## 7. Golden segmentation fixtures

Recommended layout (see review §3.8):

```
tests/fixtures/segmentation/
  qwen_moe_tp4_minimal/
    kernel_details_rank0.csv
    expected_step_segments.json
    expected_layer_segments.json
  argmax_not_boundary/
    kernel_details.csv
    expected_no_standalone_step_boundary.json
  companion_layer/
    kernel_details.csv
    expected_companion_layer.json
```

Tests: `test_operator_taxonomy_rules.py`,
`test_segmentation_strategy_rules.py`,
`test_known_counterexamples.py`,
`test_stage_resume_contract.py`.

This is the prerequisite for landing §5b (segmentation strategy YAML)
safely.

## 8. UI-only heuristic → diagnostic findings

`compute_ep_balance`, `assess_companion_run`, `detect_attention_subtype`,
`derive_layer_composition`, `guess_model_structure` are flagged
`UI-only` in the HTML (see ribbon on the L1 KPI strip and the Composition
column header in L2). Promoting them into `diagnostics.py` proper means
emitting them as `ep_load_imbalance_suspected` /
`reduced_work_or_dummy_rank` / `rank_workload_asymmetry` findings with
real `evidence_ids` plus a non-empty `limitations` string when the
heuristic is necessarily soft. Deferred because it requires alignment
work in `cross_rank.py` first (a finding-grade EP imbalance claim needs
per-step alignment, not just a per-rank wall-time aggregate).

## 9. `--remote-output-dir` semantics

Wrapper now accepts `--remote-output-dir <abs>` for partial reruns.
Open follow-ups:

* When the user reuses a remote output dir but the local run dir is new,
  we still tar-sync the framework — that's fine, but we could skip the
  sync if `<framework>/.version` matches the local checkout.
* The wrapper does not yet verify that the remote dir belongs to the
  same `remote_profile_root`. A small sanity check (read remote
  `manifest.json:input.root`, compare to current `--remote-profile-root`)
  would catch foot-guns.

## 10. `segment.py` exact-cover performance

`validate_unresolved_composite_bodies` calls
`sequence_occurrence_count(sequence, template)` for every plan/template
pair. The inner loop is brute-force `O(n·m·|template|)` substring
matching. On a dsv4 prefill rank (~3k complete plans × ~50 recurring
templates × avg seq_len ~15) this is ~10-30 s, and the surrounding
`exact_cover_sequence` memoized DP adds another large constant. The
8-minute dsv4 prefill segment stage observed during the May 2026 sweep
is plausibly dominated by this code path.

A KMP-based occurrence counter (`O(n+m)` per pair) or pre-indexed
template-anchor table (`O(n)` per plan, amortized) would remove the
hot spot without changing semantics. Defer this until segmentation
strategy externalization (§5b) lands, so the perf work and the rule
restructuring touch `segment.py` together.

Acceptance: dsv4 prefill segment stage finishes in < 60 s; existing
unit tests in `tests/test_segment_validator.py` continue to pass.

## 11. `ascend-profiling-anomaly` overlap — RESOLVED (deprecate)

The user-level `ascend-profiling-anomaly` skill (in `.claude/`) still
operates on raw kernel_details for ad-hoc anomaly hunts. Once this
skill stabilizes, decide whether to (a) deprecate the anomaly skill,
or (b) have it call into this skill's framework as a thin orchestrator.

**Resolution (profiling-skills refactor, Phase 2):** option (a). The
anomaly skill's unique detection capabilities were salvaged into this
framework with thresholds unchanged (its rulebook §10/§11/§12):

- `PRELAUNCH_GAP_HEAVY` / `TAIL_GAP_HEAVY` step tags and
  `prelaunch_gap_ms` / `tail_gap_ms` columns (`summarize.neighbor_gap_map`,
  `summarize.anomaly_tags`);
- rank-level `RECURRING_BUBBLE_PATTERN` rollup + `dominant_idle_pattern`
  (`summarize.recurring_bubble_rollup`, `diagnostics.diagnose_recurring_bubbles`);
- conservative `PARTIAL_CAPTURE_BOUNDARY`
  (`summarize.apply_partial_capture_boundary_tags`);
- host-side bubble soft attribution from `trace_view.json`
  (`host_trace.py`, `evidence/bubble_windows.jsonl:soft_attribution`).

Already covered before the salvage (verified identical thresholds):
bubble detection (`common.bubble_windows`, `DEVICE_IDLE_GAP_HEAVY` /
`INTERNAL_BUBBLE_HEAVY`), wait-anchor false hotspots
(`0.95 / 10 us / top-10`), AICPU exposure (`0.9 / 0.2`). The anomaly
skill's Mode-1 orchestration (collect + analyze) is owned by
`ascend-profiling-collection`; its `--machine` entry is deprecated.
The old skill keeps a DEPRECATED banner pointing here and is no longer
maintained.

## 11. db-direct follow-ups (v2 round)

- `Wait Time(us)` is not exactly reconstructible from
  `ascend_pytorch_profiler_*.db` (the exporter's raw-tick queue model is
  not persisted). The adapter's adopted semantics (same-stream /
  device-level gap; p50 deviation 0.06us) is documented in
  `knowledge/db_source_mapping.yaml:documented_differences`. If CANN
  ever persists raw ticks, revisit.
- `cube_utilization(%)` uses the platform constant `total_cores=20`
  (Ascend910B/A3) in the mapping YAML; other chips need the constant
  updated (golden diff will expose it).
- `verify_outputs` remote/local are parallel implementations (shell vs
  pathlib) kept in sync by selftest; consider converging.

## 12. Related knowledge references

Retrieval belongs to the installed knowledge package and is used on demand by
the Agent. Report generation preserves existing reference links but does not
perform queries or start an index. There is no local scorer, automatic knowledge
enrichment or knowledge-maintenance workflow for this analyzer.

## 13. Wrapper convergence leftovers

- `resolve_execution_target` exists in three near-copies
  (analysis `_common.py`, serving `_common.py` delegates to lib,
  memory-profiling `_common.py`). Converge analysis + memory-profiling
  onto `domain-lib/vaws_remote_target.py` (`resolve_remote_target`).
- tar-over-ssh sync primitives + `ssh_stream` + `remote_python_with_module`
  in analysis `_common.py` are generic; move to lib when a second
  consumer appears.
- Wrapper still tar-syncs the framework on every run; a `.version`
  marker check could skip no-change syncs.

## 14. Not-worth-it list (checked, deliberately untouched)

- segment.py regime/repeated-body O(n^3) and exact-cover brute force
  (deferred §10/§5b): correctness-critical; needs golden fixtures across
  real model captures before any algorithmic rewrite. The A4 anchoring
  hardening (degradation diagnostic + layer-count invariant) is the
  safety net until then.
- `normalized_name_key` in model_context.py diverges from
  segment/classify (deletes vs folds non-alnum): confirm intent before
  merging; segment/classify versions are already aligned.
