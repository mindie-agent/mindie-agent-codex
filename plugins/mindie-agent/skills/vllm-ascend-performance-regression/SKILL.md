name: vllm-ascend-performance-regression
description: Plan, record, and analyze controlled baseline-versus-candidate vLLM Ascend serving performance experiments with isolated sessions, identical non-code configuration, alternating A/B order, warmup exclusion, variance and outlier reporting, and metric-specific regression thresholds. Use for throughput, TTFT, TPOT, ITL, acceptance-rate, startup-time, or HBM regression checks. Do not use for correctness, single-state measurement, HBM component attribution, or profiling root-cause analysis.

# vllm-ascend-performance-regression

Run or analyze a controlled baseline-versus-candidate serving experiment and apply metric-specific regression thresholds.

Choose the workload and metrics that reflect the user-visible change. Set threshold and direction per metric. Keep non-code conditions comparable and inspect variance, outliers and failed requests before attributing a delta to code.

## Agent entry

Run this Skill's script with the Python interpreter configured for the MindIE plugin (the `python` value in the `MINDIE_AGENT_CONFIG` JSON). Resolve the script by its absolute path under the installed Skill directory; the business checkout stays the working directory. No old checkout adapter, project environment or bootstrap is loaded.

```text
python /absolute/plugin/skills/vllm-ascend-performance-regression/scripts/performance_regression.py --config experiment.json
```

The business config names baseline.sources and candidate.sources (actual vllm and vllm-ascend worktrees), benchmark options, runs, warmups and thresholds. The collector passes each source selection to that run without changing task defaults, waits for its managed service, warms each launch, alternates A/B order, records runtime observations, and releases owned executions. --results accepts existing measurement files for report-only use. Missing runtime evidence yields an inconclusive report.

Preparation and release use bounded coordinator waits on the same execution.
The collector accepts compact serving receipts and performs business readiness
through the shared serving probe; no client-side status polling is required.

For a single-state throughput measurement use benchmark. For root-cause timing attribution use profiling collection and analysis.
