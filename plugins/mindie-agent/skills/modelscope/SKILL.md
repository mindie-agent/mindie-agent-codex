# ModelScope

Use the bundled manager with `uv run --no-project python` on each platform.
It starts downloads and verification in a background worker and reports compact status.

- `scripts/modelscope_auto.py` - status, auto-resume, background download, and post-download verification
- `scripts/download_from_modelscope.py` - low-level single-model downloader
- `scripts/modelscope_download_status.py` - low-level size status
- `scripts/verify_modelscope_sha256.py` - low-level SHA256 verification

Do not inline long `nohup`/`setsid` shell blocks. Do not read or tail large logs unless a task fails or the user asks.

## Model Mapping

Represent every model as `MODEL_ID=LOCAL_DIR`.

- `MODEL_ID` must be `namespace/name`.
- `LOCAL_DIR` must be explicit.
- If the user says “to `/root`” without a model subdirectory, use `/root/namespace/name`.
- Use revision `master` unless specified.
- Repeat `--model MODEL_ID=LOCAL_DIR` for multiple models.

## Download / Resume / Auto Complete

For `$modelscope download`, resume, repair-after-approval, or “check and continue if incomplete”, run:

```bash
uv run --no-project python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/modelscope_auto.py" ensure \
  --model "$MODEL_ID=$LOCAL_DIR" \
  --revision "$REVISION"
```

`ensure` behavior:

- If a task is active, leave it running and report compact status.
- If a recorded process is alive but its identity cannot be checked, report
  `identity-unavailable` with a nonzero exit status and leave it running.
  `ensure` does not start a second worker while that observation is unknown.
- If official files are incomplete and no task is active, start a detached background worker in the same `LOCAL_DIR`.
- If files are complete but verification is missing or stale, start detached SHA256 verification.
- If verification reports a real mismatch, use the existing authorization to decide whether to repair; ask only if replacing those files was not authorized.
- It preserves partial files and never deletes weights.

The manager writes `download.pid`, `modelscope_sha256.report.json`, `modelscope_sha256.tsv`, and `SHA256SUMS` in `LOCAL_DIR`. Download and verification progress use the shared, redacted, rotated diagnostic log root. The background worker owns its output collector, so logs continue after the launcher exits. Historical local log files are preserved but no longer appended.

Pass `--auto-install` when the requested download needs a missing ModelScope SDK.
It resolves that dependency in an isolated uv environment and records the actual
SDK version and interpreter in the download log; it does not install into the
selected workspace environment. Use `--help` for optional concurrency settings.

Proxy options:

- Pass no proxy option by default.
- Add `--no-proxy` only when requested.
- Add `--proxy "$PROXY_URL"` only when provided.

## Status

For explicit status only:

```bash
uv run --no-project python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/modelscope_auto.py" status \
  --model "$MODEL_ID=$LOCAL_DIR" \
  --revision "$REVISION"
```

If the user asks for all tasks, require a root and run `--root ROOT`; the script discovers `*/download.pid` and infers `namespace/name` from the last two path components.

Report only the compact script output: state, percent, local/expected size, PID, verification state, and directory. Include log paths only when useful.

Completion requires every expected file to have the expected size. A SHA256
report is reused only while the model ID, revision, official sizes/hashes and
local file signatures still match. An old report or a changed file requires
verification again; status does not rehash large weight files.
The download record also retains the worker's birth time and command. A reused
PID alone does not count as an active download.
New workers are detached only after that identity has been saved; a failed
startup cleans up its owned processes. `identity-unavailable` is distinct from
an inactive worker: a later status call can recover after identity access returns.

## Verify

For explicit verification:

```bash
uv run --no-project python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/modelscope_auto.py" verify \
  --model "$MODEL_ID=$LOCAL_DIR" \
  --revision "$REVISION"
```

Verification ignores `.gitattributes` by default because it is Git metadata, not model weight content. Do not repair or redownload solely because `.gitattributes` is absent.

## Output Rules

- Keep responses short.
- Do not paste large command output or progress bars.
- Summarize each model as `state`, percent, PID, verification result, and paths.
- If the execution policy rejects a required operation, report the exact rejection and do not bypass it.
