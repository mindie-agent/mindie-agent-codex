"""Observational comparability certificate for two-state experiments.

A pair of runs that differ in two ways cannot be attributed to either. This
module issues a certificate by diffing the identity recorded from each of two
actual runs, key by key. Every leaf is labelled ``observed``, ``declared``, or
``unknown``. A declaration is never promoted to an observation.

The certificate hangs off Run Manifest v1 as an artifact
(``comparability-certificate``). A comparison entry point must call
``consume_certificate`` before it is permitted to emit ``passed``. Consuming
recomputes the verdict from the identity body; a handwritten
``verdict: comparable`` is not accepted.

Empty ``workspace_snapshot`` / ``environment`` / ``model`` / ``topology`` are
recorded as ``unknown`` and block ``comparable`` (and therefore ``passed``).
Null and whitespace-only identity scalars are the same kind of unknown: they
do not satisfy must-observe and do not count as group presence. False, ``0``,
and domain-valid empty lists such as no extra serve/bench args remain evidence.
They are not rejected at run creation: planning before observation is
legitimate. Two empty objects comparing equal would be the worst form of
laundering, so emptiness is never treated as agreement.

Each certificate side retains declaration/observation mismatches so
``consume_certificate`` can recompute them. Winning leaves alone are not
enough: the observed value replaced the declared one.
