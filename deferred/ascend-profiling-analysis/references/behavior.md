# Profiling Analysis Skill Behavior

## Relationship to remote-dev

Use remote-dev companion tools (`remote_*` MCP tools, launched via
`uv run remote-dev` / MCP) for ad hoc remote
read/edit/bash/search/patch around profiling roots and generated reports.
This skill owns analysis semantics and uses the current MindIE execution and remote-dev interfaces. Old project adapters are not supported.

## Lifecycle

1. **Resolve target** from `--execution-id` / `--host`, or a collection manifest's recorded `execution_id` / `host`. Do not guess a session from cwd.
2. **Resolve input**:
   - `--manifest <local-run-dir>/manifest.json` → produced by `ascend-profiling-collection`. We require `analysis_status == "ok"` and a non-empty `remote_profile_root`.
   - `--remote-profile-root <abs-path>` → raw remote path (used for historical roots not collected through the collection skill).
   - Optional context: `--model-id`, `--model-config`, `--hardware-model`, and `--hardware-profile` are passed to the remote analysis. Local `--model-config` / `--hardware-profile` files are uploaded into the remote run dir first.
3. **Dependency preflight**: select a supported remote Python that can import `yaml`. If no interpreter satisfies the skill's `requirements.txt`, return `phase=dependency_preflight` before syncing or running analysis.
4. **Parity sync** (light): tar-over-ssh only `scripts/ascend_profile/` from the local skill dir to `<remote-work-dir>/ascend_profile/`. Excludes `__pycache__` and `*.pyc`. Writes only the explicitly selected analysis directory.
5. **Remote analyze**: run `python3 -m ascend_profile.analyze <ROOT> --output <OUT> --verbose` from inside `<remote-work-dir>`. stdout/stderr is streamed back so the agent can see stage timings live.
6. **Validate artifacts**: every required artifact must exist, and `segment_manifest.json` must have `hard_errors == 0` and `interior_island_total == 0`.
7. **Pull artifacts**: mode-dependent. `fast` (default): `report/report.md` + `report/analysis_summary.json` + all `*_manifest.json` + class-level summary CSVs + `diagnosis_findings.json` (17 items). `full`: the previous lightweight set (`report/` incl. `assets/`, manifests, findings, summary CSVs, `step_segments.json`, `layer_segments.json`, `structure_evidence_graph.json`, `evidence_index.csv`). Use `--keep-remote-output` to mirror the entire remote output dir locally.
8. **Emit JSON** on stdout. Progress lines (`__MINDIE_PROGRESS__=...`) go to stderr.

## Required artifacts (single-root `analyze`)

These must exist in the remote output dir before the skill declares success:

```
manifest.json
segment_manifest.json
diagnosis_findings.json
report/report.md
report/report.xlsx
report/report.html
```

The HTML report is best-effort: if rendering hits an exception the analyze stage
still succeeds, a stub `report.html` with the error message is written, and
`report/manifest.json:html_status` is set to `error`. Callers should check that
field before assuming the rich HTML view is available.

Lightweight pull set (always pulled when `--keep-remote-output` is not set):

```
manifest.json
normalize_manifest.json
segment_manifest.json
classify_manifest.json
summary_manifest.json
cross_rank_manifest.json
diagnosis_findings.json
evidence_index.csv
raw_kernel_index.csv
rank_summary.csv
step_summary.csv
step_anatomy.csv
step_class_summary.csv
layer_summary.csv
layer_class_summary.csv
block_summary.csv
block_class_summary.csv
operator_summary.csv
operator_class_summary.csv
operator_efficiency_summary.csv
model_insights.json
model_context_summary.csv
model_inferred_config.csv
model_feature_summary.csv
model_layer_type_summary.csv
model_candidate_summary.csv
model_config_overview.csv
model_parameter_estimate.csv
model_kv_cache_estimate.csv
model_config_feature_summary.csv
hardware_insights.json
hardware_summary.csv
hardware_theoretical_peaks.csv
hccl_op_summary.csv
hccl_class_summary.csv
wait_anchor_ops.csv
aicpu_summary.csv
cross_rank_alignment.csv
cross_rank_alignment.json
step_segments.json
layer_segments.json
block_segments.json
class_signatures.json
structure_evidence_graph.json
report/manifest.json
report/report.md
report/report.xlsx
report/report.html
```

Excluded from the lightweight set (large or only useful for deep debug; pull on demand with `--keep-remote-output` or by explicit `remote_artifact_pull.py` against the remote output dir):

```
normalized_event_index.csv
normalized_event_index.jsonl
evidence/bubble_windows.jsonl
```

## Local run directory layout

```
.mindie/profiling-analysis/runs/<timestamp>_<tag>/
  skill_run.json                   # this skill's run metadata
  collection_manifest.json         # copy of the input collection manifest (if --manifest)
  manifest.json                    # mirror of remote manifest.json
  segment_manifest.json
  diagnosis_findings.json
  ...                              # other lightweight pull artifacts
  report/
    report.md
    report.xlsx
    manifest.json
  sweep_summary.json               # only for profile_sweep.py
  sweep_class_rollup.csv           # only for profile_sweep.py (multi-root rollup)
```

## Remote work directory layout

```
<remote-work-dir>/                  # default /tmp/ascend_profile_framework
  ascend_profile/                   # tar-synced from local skill dir
  runs/<timestamp>_<tag>/           # single-root analyze output
  sweeps/<timestamp>_<tag>/         # multi-root sweep output
```

The skill never mutates anything outside `<remote-work-dir>` and the user-provided profiling roots.

## Configuration priority

| Source | Role |
|--------|------|
| `--manifest` | Authoritative for `remote_profile_root` and `analysis_status`. The skill refuses to run when the manifest reports anything other than `analysis_status == "ok"`. |
| `--remote-profile-root` | Used only when `--manifest` is not supplied. The agent is responsible for confirming the path is correct. |
| `--remote-work-dir` | Optional override; default `/tmp/ascend_profile_framework`. |
| `--keep-remote-output` | Pull every file back, instead of the lightweight subset. Use only when you actually need `normalized_event_index.csv` or bubble window evidence. |
| `--remote-timeout` | Hard wall-clock cap for the remote command. Single-root default 3600s; sweep default 14400s (matches the published 61-root regression baseline). |
| `--model-id` / `--model-config` | Optional user/model registry context. Config is an optional comparison source; profiling-derived inference still works without it. For known models, missing layer count is resolved by enumerating catalog variants and fetching `config.json` from Hugging Face / ModelScope when needed; unresolved counts stay unknown rather than guessed. |
| `--hardware-model` / `--hardware-profile` | Optional capture-hardware context. Use it for historical roots; current remote host hardware is not proof of capture hardware. |
| CANN `platform_config` scan | Default source for theoretical hardware peaks. Disable with `--no-cann-hardware-scan` only for debugging. |

## Profiling-first model analysis

The skill infers a model fingerprint from profiling artifacts before looking
at any optional config file. The summary/report stage exports:

- `model_inferred_config.csv`: observed/candidate config fields, including
  layer count, hidden/intermediate/expert/head dimensions, profile sequence
  length, `vocab_size_or_lm_head_shard` when lm_head/logits shapes are visible,
  and a rank-visible matmul parameter lower bound.
- `model_feature_summary.csv`: observed architecture features from operator
  categories, for example MoE, MLA, CSA/HCA/DSA, dense flash attention, linear
  attention/Mamba/GDN, and RoPE.
- `model_layer_type_summary.csv`: layer/block structure sequences derived from
  block decomposition.
- `model_candidate_summary.csv`: local fingerprint-catalog candidate matches.
- `model_insights.json`: machine-readable rollup and limitations.

The candidate model table is a search aid, not a diagnosis conclusion. It may
match a model by exact vocab size or by a visible vocab shard that evenly
divides the catalog vocab. Single-rank captures report rank-visible weight
information only; full parameter totals require the TP/EP/DP strategy and
weight-sharding rules.

When a user supplies a fuzzy model family such as `dsv4` or `qwen3.5`, the
early model resolver enumerates the concrete variants registered in
`knowledge/model_fingerprints.json`.  Segment-stage model guidance may consume
only a concrete candidate whose public/local config or validated
profile-visible layer hint matches the current profile.  Quantization and data
format suffixes are ignored for structure selection and remain dtype/weight
metadata only.  Substring (non-exact) catalog hits are weaker evidence and are
capped at `medium` confidence; only an exact catalog-name match can report
`high`.  External `config.json` fetches are skipped for candidates that are
not plausible `org/name` repo ids, so family display names never turn into
real Hugging Face / ModelScope requests.

The early resolver has two catalog-based paths before any statistical
fallback:

- Explicit user context: exact model ids, fuzzy family names, and structure
  descriptions are resolved through the catalog first.  Structure words such as
  CSA, DSA, HCA, compressor, lightning indexer, sparse shared-KV, and
  linear/Mamba map to catalog features.  `moe` / gating alone is generic
  architecture evidence only.
- Profiling operator fingerprint: when the user does not provide model context,
  the resolver scores the observed `op_categories` against each
  `model_fingerprints.json:operator_match` rule.  Examples: KV compressor is a
  DSV4 fast signal; lightning indexer plus sparse shared-KV and no compressor
  is DSA; MoE gating plus linear/Mamba is Qwen3.5/GDN-style hybrid evidence.

Plain feature-overlap matching remains available only as the last conservative
fallback and must not promote a single generic feature such as MoE into a
specific model or layer count.

## Hardware peak and MFU context

The skill separates three hardware concepts:

- capture hardware provenance: user input, collection manifest, hardware profile,
  or profiler metadata when available. Current analysis-host hardware is not
  assumed to be provenance for historical profiling roots.
- theoretical peak: derived from CANN `platform_config/*.ini` rows, for example
  `cube_core_cnt * cube_freq * M * N * K * 2`.
- sustained peak: practical operator-path factors from
  `knowledge/hardware_peak_measurements.json`.

Outputs:

- `hardware_theoretical_peaks.csv`: all CANN platform config rows discovered on
  the analysis host, with FP16/BF16/INT8 theoretical cube peaks.
- `hardware_summary.csv`: the selected hardware denominator and sustained
  factors.
- `hardware_insights.json`: machine-readable rollup and limitations.

Current measured knowledge includes Ascend910B4 / A2 32G from remote 131:

- FP16/BF16 dense matmul sustained factor: `0.95`.
- INT8 `npu_quant_matmul` sustained factor: `0.65`.

MFU denominators use theoretical peak. Operator roofline/reclaim ranking uses
sustained peak when a measured factor is available.  Only FP16/BF16/INT8 peaks
are modeled: INT4 and FP8/HiF8 dtypes use the INT8 op-rate peak as the closest
available denominator, and dtypes with no modeled peak report
`no_peak_for_dtype` instead of silently assuming FP16.

## Failure policy

Hard fail (`status: "failed"` in stdout JSON, non-zero exit code):

| Phase | Cause | exit code |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| `manifest_validation` | manifest missing / malformed / `analysis_status != "ok"` / `remote_profile_root` empty | 2 |
| `parity_sync` | tar-sync of `scripts/ascend_profile/` to remote failed | 3 |
| `remote_analyze` | remote `analyze.py` exited non-zero or hit `--remote-timeout` | 4 |
| `artifact_validation` | any required artifact missing, or `segment_manifest.json` reports `hard_errors > 0` / `interior_island_total > 0` | 5 |
| `artifact_pull` | artifact manifest / SSH-streaming pull back to the local run dir failed | 6 |

Soft outcomes (still `status: "ok"`):

- Diagnosis findings with `confidence: "low"` are reported as-is. The skill does not silently downgrade or drop them.
- A finding with `confidence: "medium"` and one missing corroborating source is acceptable.
- Cross-rank asymmetries without business context (could be VIT, dummy run, encoder, decode-only, etc.) stay as `rank_workload_asymmetry` without naming a model component.

## Sweep behavior

`profile_sweep.py` is a thin wrapper around `ascend_profile.sweep`. It:

- Calls the remote sweep with all `--search-root`s the agent provides.
- Pulls back `sweep_summary.json` and `sweep_class_rollup.csv` (the multi-root rollup table) plus every successful root's `report/` and `*_manifest.json`. Use `--pull-html` to additionally fetch per-root `report/report.html` files.
- Reports a layer inventory in the form `{"(27, 40)": 17, "(24,)": 9, ...}` so the agent can cross-compare captures.
- Returns `status: "partial"` (exit code 1) when any root failed but the summary was still produced. `status: "failed"` (exit codes 3-6) is reserved for setup / pull failures that prevent the summary from being written at all.

## Evidence chain (mandatory for agent answers)

When the agent reports findings to the user, every claim must be traceable through:

```
report claim
  → diagnosis finding (diagnosis_findings.json)
  → evidence id (evidence_index.csv / structure_evidence_graph.json)
  → event / segment / alignment id
  → source path + row range (raw_kernel_index.csv)
  → original kernel_details.csv (or the equivalent db-direct event stream from
    ascend_pytorch_profiler_*.db) / trace_view.json / op_summary / communication.json
```

If a claim cannot be backed at row level, the agent must surface it as a `limitation`, not a conclusion.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Start or stop services. Use `vllm-ascend-serving`.
- Run benchmarks. Use `vllm-ascend-benchmark`.
- Collect new torch profiler data (drive `/start_profile` / `/stop_profile`, run `analyse()`). Use `ascend-profiling-collection`.
- Attribute HBM / 显存. Use `ascend-memory-profiling`.
- Edit submodule code or push commits.
- Rewrite single-rank step boundaries from cross-rank evidence (the analysis framework intentionally forbids this).

## Related knowledge

Reports preserve existing reference links for optional reading. The wrapper
performs no knowledge queries, starts no retrieval service and does not rewrite
the pulled summary to enrich it. The Agent may use the knowledge MCP tools when
related experience helps interpret a finding. References do not alter measured
findings, layer validation or analysis status.

The analyzer's bundled YAML/JSON files under
`scripts/ascend_profile/knowledge/` are implementation data. Their schemas
serve code and tests and do not prescribe a format for workspace notes.
See the [data and reference index](../scripts/ascend_profile/knowledge/index.md)
when changing the corresponding analyzer behavior.
