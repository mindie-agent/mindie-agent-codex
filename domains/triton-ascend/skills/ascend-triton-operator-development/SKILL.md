name: ascend-triton-operator-development
description: Develop a first correct Ascend Triton operator from a PyTorch reference or migrate an existing GPU Triton kernel to Ascend, including semantic audit, explicit task contracts, hardware-aware grid and tiling design, implementation, and handoff to correctness validation. Use for new kernel implementation, CUDA/GPU Triton migration, or repairing a candidate that has not yet passed correctness. Do not use for a kernel that already passes all planned cases and only needs performance tuning, for isolated torch_npu or ACLNN debugging, or for model-level graph failures.

# ascend-triton-operator-development

Implement a first correct Ascend Triton operator or migrate an existing GPU Triton kernel.

Resolve semantics from the reference and callers before selecting a grid or tile. Separate logical shape from physical layout and reductions. GPU launch assumptions need an Ascend-specific design; choose a simple correct candidate before tuning.

Run ascend-triton-kernel-validation for the candidate. Continue to optimization only after the planned correctness cases pass.

## Optional development evidence report

When a development report is useful, aggregate the implemented candidate and
its existing validation evidence. `operator.json` configures this report; it is
not a prerequisite for ordinary implementation work. Run this Skill's script with the Python interpreter configured for the MindIE plugin (the `python` value in the `MINDIE_AGENT_CONFIG` JSON). Resolve the script by its absolute path under the installed Skill directory; the business checkout stays the working directory. No old checkout adapter, project environment or bootstrap is loaded.

```text
python /absolute/domain/skills/ascend-triton-operator-development/scripts/triton_development.py --config operator.json --kernel kernel.py --validation-manifest validation/manifest.json
```

The business config contains op_name, mode, source, reference, target, cases and tolerances. The report consumes the actual kernel and validation manifest, checking kernel identity and passing case coverage. Optional --semantic-report and --sketch attach useful design artifacts.

The report aggregates supplied evidence. Imported numerical results and latency
measurements do not by themselves prove candidate NPU execution; this remains
unknown in the aggregate status. Keep the measured outcomes and use existing
runner or profiler evidence in the task assessment. That report limitation adds
no prerequisite for work already supported by valid execution evidence.
